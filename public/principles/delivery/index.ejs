<h1>Delivery principles</h1>
<p class="intro">
    These are our overarching digital and technology standards.
</p>

<h3>1. We will put user needs first</h3>
<p>
    In a dynamic connected world, our needs are ever changing. We must stay at the forefront of ideas and understand where value is created for users. The best way to do this is to release concepts routinely, testing and adjusting, seeking feedback and changing our delivery plans if we need to, we must be open to failing fast and adapting.
</p>

<h3>2. We will be open</h3>
<p>
    Sharing our code (where security and relevance allows) enables our teams to share the best of coding and practices. Not only does this reduce effort and time to delivery but enables the UKHO to demonstrate our global edge and for others to reuse our code. This will enable better interoperability for all our systems.
</p>

<h3>3. We will make things secure</h3>
<p>
    Use of the cloud enables the very best of business continuity. Working with global leaders in cloud solutions, we can leverage how others develop, deploy and use the transfer of data. The use of cloudenables speed to market and for data to reach our users as fast as possible, thereby always meeting the expectations for how our users wish to consume our data.
</p>

<h3>4. We will share, reuse, adapt and maintain technology</h3>
<p>
    We must strive to reduce wasted effort and “build once, use many.” This enables our teams to be constantly developing new and exciting products and services leveraging off the enablers developed by all our teams. Our systems should ideally be “plug and play” for all, reducing perceived and subconscious barriers to technology.
</p>

<h3>5. We will use ‘just-enough’ governance</h3>
<p>
    Our teams should stay close throughout entire lifecycles so that all barriers to delivery are reduced. All and any blockers caused by process should be actively removed and all should work towards a common goal to deliver our one programme.
</p>

<h3>6. We will make better use of data</h3>
<p>
    Data is the lifeblood of our output, be it user data, geospatial data or performance data. Duplication causes unnecessary loading and delays to our system processes and all data should be sought be single source of the truth.
</p>

<h3>7. We will attract and retain great people</h3>
<p>
    Our teams are our greatest assets. We must all seek to learning, growing and questioning how we operate and in doing so always building to develop our collective strengths. We should all have the opportunity to have access to formal and informal training, and share the great things we learn across our function, the entire UKHO and also wider Government, our Global partners and Technology partners.
