# Content design
We design experiences so that users can access content in a way that is best for all. Our Content Strategy outlines how we should use content. Content Design enables us to meet user need, using the ADMIRALTY brand's tone of voice, and our style guide to ensure users can easily access services.

## Tone of voice
To make a positive impression with everyone we deal with, we need to: make sure we understand who we are (our personality), and how we communicate (our tone of voice) ensure that we always come across consistently. 

This is particularly important for us because some people we deal with aren’t marine or hydrographic experts and most of our global customers use English as a second language. Of course, the way we communicate our key messages may vary depending on who we are talking to. For instance, we might emphasise different aspects of our story when communicating with a government official, a mariner or the local community. 

But, our tone of voice will always remain the same. These tools help you to do this in making digital products and services.  

### Our personality  
Our brand personality has been formed over many years and represents who we are, how we behave, and what makes us ‘tick’. It shapes how we work and how we communicate. Our personality influences the way people think of us, judge us and, ultimately, whether they trust us and our brand. It’s made up of many characteristics which we have distilled down to three main traits. Together, these make up who we are. 

### Authoritative  
We inspire confidence and always portray the world-leading knowledge and experience we have. 
Authoritative means:
* we are experts in our field  
* we educate and inform our audience  
* we are respected  
* we qualify what we say with facts, sources or quotes 

### Engaging  
We tell our story in a compelling way.  We are always approachable and actively encourage collaboration. 
Engaging means:
* we welcome two-way dialogue with others and prefer collaboration  
* we are open and respond positively to new ideas, people and organisations  
* we recognise the emotional as well as rational impact of what we say and do  
* our authority doesn’t come across as patronising or distant 

### Dynamic  
We are always active, forward-thinking and energising. 
Dynamic means:
* we convey a sense of pace and a positive future  
* we are creative and innovative 
* we focus on what needs to be done and finding new ways to do things  
* we seek to grow our knowledge and understanding 

### Our tone of voice  
Our tone of voice is the way we sound. It reflects our personality. To be effective it should be evident in everything we say and do – not just in our official reports and publications, but in emails, presentations and all our everyday conversations.  

The three main elements of our tone of voice help us to communicate more engagingly with our audiences. 

#### Clear  
Whoever they are, our audiences need to understand us. This is especially important because of the technical nature of what we do.  
Being clear means we:
* make sure we are easy to understand  
* explain technical terms when we use them  
* are consistent with our messages  
* are concise  
* use language and reasoning that others can easily follow and understand  

We don’t:
* ‘dumb-down’ issues but always explain clearly  
* waffle or over-elaborate  
* use acronyms unnecessarily 

#### Confident  
Being confident helps us to build authority and trust.  
Being confident means we: 
* share our knowledge, expertise and experience  
* qualify what we say with facts and evidence or quote our sources  
* are clear and succinct, prioritising key messages  
* are truthful, but positive without over /under selling  
* are clear when we don’t know something or don’t know the answer  

We don’t:
* talk down to people  
* come across as arrogant or pompous  
* exaggerate, overstate or overestimate 

#### Cordial  
We need to balance clarity and confidence with being warm and approachable, as we don’t want to come across as arrogant, clinical or unapproachable.  
Being cordial means we:  
* are welcoming and friendly  
* want to engage with others  
* are active and dynamic  
* are open, co-operative and responsive  
* talk to our audiences in a human way  

We aren’t:
* remote or impersonal 
* patronising or condescending  
* uninterested in other people’s concerns or viewpoints
