# Version 5.3.0 Release Notes

### Release date 13/02/2026

## Summary

This release introduces Dark Mode and a new Patterns section to support more consistent,
accessible, and scalable service design.

## Dark Mode

Following feedback from our user we have introduced Dark Mode to improve usability in low-light environments
and support user preference-based theming. Potentially a first step in moving toward other themes
such as dark and dusk mode used onboard ships.

<div style={{ display: "flex", gap: "1rem", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <img
    src="/updates/v5-3/get-help-light.png"
    alt="Light mode example"
    style={{
      width: "100%",
      maxWidth: "600px",
      height: "auto",
      flex: "1",
      padding: "8px",
      border: "2px solid grey",
      borderRadius: "6px"
    }}
  />
  <img
    src="/updates/v5-3/get-help-dark.png"
    alt="Dark mode example"
    style={{
      width: "100%",
      maxWidth: "600px",
      height: "auto",
      flex: "1",
      padding: "8px",
      border: "2px solid grey",
      borderRadius: "6px"
    }}
  />
</div>

### What's Included

- Full system colour support for dark theme
- Updated semantic colour mappings (background, surface, text, border, focus, status)
- Accessible contrast ratios across all core components
- Dark mode variants for:
  - Core components
  - Navigation patterns
  - Data visualisation elements
  - Form controls and validation states

### How it works

Products can enable Dark Mode using the browser settings,
we are working to implement a dark mode switch/ toggle in the near future.

### Accessibility

Dark Mode has been tested to meet WCAG 2.2 AA contrast standards. Particular attention has been given to:

- Text readability
- Status colours (success, warning, error)
- Focus states
- Data-heavy interfaces

### Implementation Guidelines

- Do not manually override component colours.
- Use semantic tokens only.
- Test content-heavy screens for contrast regressions.

## Patterns

We’ve launched a new Patterns section to support teams in solving common service design challenges consistently.
Patterns go beyond components. They provide guidance on structure, behaviour, and user intent.

### What's included

Initial patterns include:
  - Page layout structure for a geo-display and complex form
  - Content grouping strategies
  - Multi-step processes

Each pattern includes:
  - When to use it
  - When not to use it
  - Accessibility considerations
  - Content design guidance
  - Interaction behaviour
  - Example layouts
  - Relationship to components

### Why patterns?

Components alone don’t guarantee coherent services. Patterns help teams:
  - Avoid reinventing solutions
  - Reduce inconsistency across products
  - Align with user mental models
  - Design at a service level, not just a UI level

We plan in the future to introduce patterns for error messaging, complex tables and a  database search and filter.

## Minor Updates

- Removed dependency on Font Awesome
- Added [Data Collection](https://designsystem.admiralty.co.uk/patterns/data-collection) and [Find A Location](https://designsystem.admiralty.co.uk/patterns/find-a-location) pattern pages
- Updated several component examples on Documentation Website

## In our next release, we're planning to introduce:
- New "Progress Tracker" component
- Toggle button for Dark Mode
- Several package updates for improved security and maintainability
- Documentation Website improvements
