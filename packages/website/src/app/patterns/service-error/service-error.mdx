# Service Error

## Generic Error

import GenericError from "@/usage/service-error/generic-error/index.mdx"

A generic error page tells someone there is something wrong with the service. They are also known as 500 and internal server error pages.

<GenericError />

### When to use this pattern

Use a generic error page for all unexpected problems with the service.

A generic error page should only be shown for a short time. If a problem cannot be fixed quickly, close the service and use a Service unavailable page.

### How it works

The generic error page should display:

• ‘An error has occurred – [service name] – | ADMIRALTY’ as the browser window title\
• ‘An error has occurred’ as the H1\
• A text link that allows the user to return to the homepage\
• Contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need

Contact information should either:

• be a link to a specific page that includes telephone numbers and opening times\
• include all telephone numbers and opening times\
• The content should be clear, unambiguous and concise, and not blame the user.

### To make your pages compliant with WCAG 2.2:

You must always write contact information in a clear and consistent way on a Service Unavailable page and similar service error pages. This relates to [WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.2.6 Consistent help](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help.html) .

Do not use:

• breadcrumbs\
• technical jargon\
• vague, unhelpful words like maintenance, improvements\
• red text to warn people

### Research on the pattern

More research is needed to find out if people:

• can fix the problem on their own.\
• understand what has happened.\
• understand the content and if there is anything missing
