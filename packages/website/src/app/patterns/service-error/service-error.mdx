# Service Error

## Generic Error

import GenericError from "@/usage/service-error/generic-error/index.mdx"

A generic error page tells someone there is something wrong with the service. They are also known as 500 and internal server error pages.

<GenericError />

### When to use this pattern

Use a generic error page for all unexpected problems with the service.

A generic error page should only be shown for a short time. If a problem cannot be fixed quickly, close the service and use a Service unavailable page.

### How it works

The generic error page should display:

* ‘An error has occurred – [service name] – | ADMIRALTY’ as the browser window title
* ‘An error has occurred’ as the H1
* A text link that allows the user to return to the homepage
* Contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need

Contact information should either:

* be a link to a specific page that includes telephone numbers and opening times
* include all telephone numbers and opening times
* The content should be clear, unambiguous and concise, and not blame the user.

### To make your pages compliant with WCAG 2.2:

You must always write contact information in a clear and consistent way on a Service Unavailable page and similar service error pages. This relates to [WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.2.6 Consistent help](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help.html) .

Do not use:

* breadcrumbs
* technical jargon
* vague, unhelpful words like maintenance, improvements
* red text to warn people
