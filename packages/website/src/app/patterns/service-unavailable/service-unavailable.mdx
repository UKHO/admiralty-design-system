# Service Unavailable

Service Unavailable pages tells someone the service they were trying to use had been made unavailable for a reason. They are also known as 503 pages.

## Planned Maintenance

A Planned Maintenance page tells someone the service they were trying to access had been made unavailable while scheduled work is being carried out to update the service.

import PlannedMaintenance from "@/usage/service-unavailable/planned-maintenance/index.mdx"

<PlannedMaintenance />

### When to use this pattern

Use a Planned Maintenance page if a user is trying to access a service that may have been closed temporarily on the Admiralty.co.uk website.

### How it works

The Planned Maintenance section should display:

* ‘Sorry, the service is unavailable – [service name] – | ADMIRALTY’ as the browser window title
* ‘Sorry, the service is unavailable’ as the H1
* Information telling the user if or when the service will be available again.
* Contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need

<br/>

Contact information should either:

* be a link to a specific page that includes telephone numbers and opening times
* include all telephone numbers and opening times
* The content should be clear, unambiguous and concise, and not blame the user.

### To make your pages compliant with WCAG 2.2:

You must always write contact information in a clear and consistent way on a Service Unavailable page and similar service error pages. This relates to [WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.2.6 Consistent help](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help.html) .

Do not use:

* breadcrumbs
* technical jargon like 503
* vague, unhelpful words like maintenance, improvements
* red text to warn people
