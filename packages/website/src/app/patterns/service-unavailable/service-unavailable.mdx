# Service Unavailable

## Planned Maintenance

A Service Unavailable page tells someone the service they were trying to access had been made unavailable for a reason. They are also known as 503 pages.

import PlannedMaintenance from "@/usage/service-unavailable/planned-maintenance/index.mdx"

<PlannedMaintenance />

### When to use this pattern

Use a Service Unavailable page if a user is trying to access a service that may have been closed either temporarily or permanently on the website.

### How it works

The Service Unavailable page should display:

• ‘Sorry, the service is unavailable – [service name] – | ADMIRALTY’ as the browser window title\
• ‘Sorry, the service is unavailable’ as the H1\
• Information telling the user if or when the service will be available again.\
• Contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need

Contact information should either:

• be a link to a specific page that includes telephone numbers and opening times\
• include all telephone numbers and opening times\
• The content should be clear, unambiguous and concise, and not blame the user.

### To make your pages compliant with WCAG 2.2:

You must always write contact information in a clear and consistent way on a Service Unavailable page and similar service error pages. This relates to WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.2.6 Consistent help.

Do not use:

• breadcrumbs\
• technical jargon like 503\
• vague, unhelpful words like maintenance, improvements\
• red text to warn people

### Research on the pattern

More research is needed to find out if people:

• can fix the problem on their own.\
• understand what has happened.\
• understand the content and if there is anything missing
