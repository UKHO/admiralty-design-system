# Service Unavailable

## Planned Maintenance

import PlannedMaintenance from "@/usage/service-unavailable/planned-maintenance/index.mdx"

<PlannedMaintenance />

## Emergency Maintenance

import EmergencyMaintenance from "@/usage/service-unavailable/emergency-maintenance/index.mdx"

An Emergency Maintenance page tells someone the service they are trying to access had been made unavailable while an issue with the service is being repaired.

<EmergencyMaintenance />

### When to use this pattern

Use an Emergency Maintenance page if a user is trying to access a service that is unavailable while it is being fixed by Admiralty.

### How it works

The Emergency Maintenance page should display:

• ‘Sorry, there is a problem – [service name] – | ADMIRALTY’ as the browser window title\
• ‘Sorry, there is a problem with the service’ as the H1\
• Contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need

Contact information should either:

• be a link to a specific page that includes telephone numbers and opening times\
• include all telephone numbers and opening times\
• The content should be clear, unambiguous and concise, and not blame the user.

### To make your pages compliant with WCAG 2.2:

You must always write contact information in a clear and consistent way on an Emergency Maintenance page and similar service error pages. This relates to WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.2.6 Consistent help.

Do not use:

• breadcrumbs\
• technical jargon\
• vague, unhelpful words like maintenance, improvements\
• red text to warn people

### Research on the pattern

More research is needed to find out if people:

• can fix the problem on their own.\
• understand what has happened.\
• understand the content and if there is anything missing
