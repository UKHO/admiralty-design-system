# Page Not Found

## Error 401-403

401 and 403 error pages tell someone they page they do not have permission to view the requested page.

import Error401To403 from "@/usage/page-not-found/error-401-403/index.mdx"

<Error401To403 />

### When to use this pattern

Use a ‘401’ page if a user request is trying to access a page that they are not authorised to view on the Admiralty.co.uk website. This happens if the request fails to provide valid authentication e.g. username or password.

Use a ‘403’ page is shown if a user request has provided valid credentials (e.g. username or password) but lacks permission to view the requested resource on Admiralty.co.uk. The user is informed access is forbidden despite having supplied valid authentication.

### How it works

The 401 and 403 pages should display:

• ‘Unauthorised – [service name] – | ADMIRALTY’ as the browser window title\
• ‘You do not have the necessary permissions to view this page’ as the H1\
• A text link to a page that allows the user to log in again\
• Contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need

Contact information should either:

• be a link to a specific page that includes telephone numbers and opening times
• include all telephone numbers and opening times
• The content should be clear, unambiguous and concise, and not blame the user.

### To make your pages compliant with WCAG 2.2:

You must always write contact information in a clear and consistent way on an Error 401/403 – Forbidden page and similar service error pages. This relates to WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.2.6 Consistent help.

Do not use:

• breadcrumbs\
• technical jargon like 401, 403 or bad request\
• informal or humorous words\
• red text to warn people

### Research on the pattern

More research is needed to find out if people:

• can fix the problem on their own.\
• understand what has happened.\
• understand the content and if there is anything missing.
