# Patterns
‘Patterns’ allow users to perform tasks in a clear and consistent way across the whole website.
Patterns may be made up of several separate components and are shown here with an explanation of how they should be used.

Where they need to, these patterns follow new WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.2 Guidelines and have a link to the WCAG that provide more information.

Each pattern is shown with HTML code and guidance on its use.
