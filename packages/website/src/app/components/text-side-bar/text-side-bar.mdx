# Text side bar

Use navigation to organise your content and help users find what they're looking for.

## Contents

## Basic

Use the text side bar component when the interface design leaves no room to show a header.

import Basic from "@/usage/text-side-bar/basic/index.mdx";

<Basic />

## Accessibility

Visual contrast is strong and the text side bar supports keyboard navigation by users, supplying another way to explore content with easy access.
