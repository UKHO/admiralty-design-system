# Button

Use buttons to guide users towards completing a task. Buttons should include text that clearly describes the action they perform. [View this component on GitHub](https://github.com/UKHO/admiralty-design-system/tree/main/packages/core/src/components/button)

## Contents

## Primary button

A primary button is the main call to action. It should be used as the main action for the page, or stage in the service. Primary buttons need to be placed carefully, acting as a definite next step and ideally not be used multiple times in one page.

import PrimaryButton from "@/usage/button/primary-button/index.mdx";

<PrimaryButton />

## Primary button with icon

The Primary button with icon is used to provide extra affordance to the action being taken. Adding an arrow to a ‘Next’ button tells a user which way they will be going. Adding a file icon to ‘Download’ helps them know the format things might come in.

import PrimaryButtonWithIcon from "@/usage/button/primary-button-with-icon/index.mdx";

<PrimaryButtonWithIcon />

## Secondary button

Secondary buttons are used as an action state _within_ a process, with the summary action being made by a Primary button. They can be used as a hierarchically secxondary action also.

import SecondaryButton from "@/usage/button/secondary-button/index.mdx";

<SecondaryButton />

## Icon

Use this icon button in mainly visual interactions such as map tooling.

import Icon from "@/usage/button/icon/index.mdx";

<Icon />

## Primary icon

Use this icon button as the active state on a map tool, or as the main call to action in a component such as the search bar.

import PrimaryIcon from "@/usage/button/primary-icon/index.mdx";

<PrimaryIcon />

## Disabled button

An inactive or disabled button should have a clear and obvious usage related to the completion of actions in a page. The button would become active as part of the user journey. Ensure labelling supports the presence of an inactive / disabled button and use sparingly with more of a focus on content guidance than this option to tell users what they need to do.

import DisabledButton from "@/usage/button/disabled-button/index.mdx";

<DisabledButton />

## Accessibility

All buttons need to have useful aria labels added to them, so users with screen readers can hear what the button action is, as well as those seeing it visually. The contrast levels of our buttons are AAA WCAG compliant. Icon buttons should use correct labelling. Secondary buttons have a similar style to an input field, so use labels to ensure users understand the call to action.
