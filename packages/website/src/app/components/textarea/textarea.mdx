# Textarea
Use a textarea when the user is expected to enter more than a single line of text.

## Contents

## Basic
The textarea component should be used for large amounts of text. Use other form elements for smaller amounts.

import Basic from "@/usage/text-area/basic/index.mdx";

<Basic />

## Disabled
Use the disabled component when the design calls for it.

import Disabled from "@/usage/text-area/disabled/index.mdx";

<Disabled />

## Validation
Use validation messages to inform users that an action is required, for example entering text into the field.

import Validation from "@/usage/text-area/validation/index.mdx";

<Validation />

## With text
Text can be pre-populated into the textarea.

import WithText from "@/usage/text-area/with-text/index.mdx";

<WithText />

## Accessibility
Users are able to enter a large amount of text into this component, it accommodates keyboard navigation and is labelled correctly.
