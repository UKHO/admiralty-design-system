<SomeProgress />

## No progress

import NoProgress from "@/usage/progress-bar/no-progress/index.mdx";

<NoProgress />

## Maximum progress

Use the progress bar and its various states to signal to users that the system is doing something.

import MaximumProgress from "@/usage/progress-bar/maximum-progress/index.mdx";

<MaximumProgress />

## Error

Use the error state to signal to users that something has gone wrong.

import Error from "@/usage/progress-bar/error/index.mdx";

<Error />

## Labelled

## Accessibility

The component can be given an accessible label that describes the element. As the component is a visual signifier, care should be taken to explain to visually impaired users what progress is being indicated, for example the progress of their download.
