# Dialogue

Use dialogue boxes to convey important information to the user.

## Contents

## Information

Use this dialogue component to alert users to important information about their experience.

import Information from "@/usage/dialogue/information/index.mdx";

<Information />

## Success

Use the success dialogue to confirm to the user that an important action has successfully taken place.

import Success from "@/usage/dialogue/success/index.mdx";

<Success />

## Warning

Use the warning dialogue to warn users if they're about to do something that is destructive or when the result of an action is unexpected.

import Warning from "@/usage/dialogue/warning/index.mdx";

<Warning />

## Error

Use the error dialogue to highlight problems to the user. This might be a problem with information they have provided or a problem with our systems that is preventing them from doing something.

import Error from "@/usage/dialogue/error/index.mdx";

<Error />

## Error Summary

Use the error dialogue to display a summary of error messages. Each message links back to the input that has an error.

import ErrorSummary from "@/usage/dialogue/error-summary/index.mdx";

<ErrorSummary />

## Accessibility

Our dialogue components are very important as a way of communicating with a user. They are AA WCAG compliant for colour and contrast. Content in these components should be written in easy to understand and direct language.
