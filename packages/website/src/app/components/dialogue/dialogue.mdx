# Dialogue

Use dialogue boxes to convey important information to the user. [View this component on GitHub](https://github.com/UKHO/admiralty-design-system/tree/main/packages/core/src/components/dialogue)

## Contents

## Information

Use this dialogue component to alert users to important information about their experience.

import Information from "@/usage/dialogue/information/index.mdx";

<Information />

## Success

Use the success dialogue to confirm to the user that an important action has successfully taken place.

import Success from "@/usage/dialogue/success/index.mdx";

<Success />

## Warning

Use the warning dialogue to warn users if they're about to do something that is destructive or when the result of an action is unexpected.

import Warning from "@/usage/dialogue/warning/index.mdx";

<Warning />

## Error

Use the error dialogue to highlight problems to the user. This might be a problem with information they have provided or a problem with our systems that is preventing them from doing something.

import Error from "@/usage/dialogue/error/index.mdx";

<Error />

## Accessibility

Our dialogue components are very important as a way of communicating with a user. They are AA WCAG compliant for colour and contrast. Content in these components should be written in easy to understand and direct language.

## Content Design

When using the dialogue component, you must:
make it clear why you are displaying the dialogue using plain language
help users to understand what will happen next, including timeframes if relevant.
Have clear and concise content and do not use:
red text to warn people.

Specifically for info dialogues, you must:
have clear and concise content and do not use vague, unhelpful words like ‘maintenance’ or ‘improvements’
include contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need
include a link to another service, if they can use it to do what they came to do.

Specifically for warning dialogues, you must:
help users to understand what will happen next based on their next action.

Specifically for error dialogues, you must:
include information about what has happened to their answers if they are in the middle of a transaction
include contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need
include a link to another service, if they can use it to do what they came to do.

Contact information should either be:
a link to a specific page that includes numbers and opening times
include all numbers and opening times.

Have clear and concise content and do not use:
jargon like 500 or bad request
‘We are experiencing technical difficulties’.
