# Readmore

For use when users elect to access more content. [View this component on GitHub](https://github.com/UKHO/admiralty-design-system/tree/main/packages/core/src/components/read-more)

## Contents

## Basic

Use the readmore component to expand content linked to a field, or element inside a page. It is designed to take up minimal space so can be used to hide content in a form, or extra content users elect to read.

import Basic from "@/usage/read-more/basic/index.mdx";

<Basic />

## Accessibility

Ensure users with screen readers can easily navigate to the content inside the readmore expansion.

## Content Design

When using the read more component, you must:
write the heading and summary line like any other button text
use sentence case
describe the content that will show
keep it short (screen readers might find it difficult to navigate the component if the button text is too long).

Do not use the read more component if:
itâ€™s content that all users need to see.
you can simplify or reduce the amount of content.
