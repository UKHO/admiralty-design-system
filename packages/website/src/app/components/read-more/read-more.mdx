# Readmore
For use when users elect to access more content.

## Basic
Use the readmore component to expand content linked to a field, or element inside a page. It is designed to take up minimal space so can be used to hide content in a form, or extra content users elect to read.

## Accessibility
Ensure users with screen readers can easily navigate to the content inside the readmore expansion.
