# Radio

Radio buttons should be used within the radio group component. When used inside a radio group, only one radio in the group will be selected at any time.

## Contents

## Basic

Use radio buttons for simple questions with only two or three options.

import Basic from "@/usage/radio/basic/index.mdx";

<Basic />

## Checked

Use the checked version when an option should be selected by default.

## Disabled

Use a disabled radio button to prevent the radio button from being selected or changed.

## Accessibility

Radio buttons will function with keyboard navigation. Labelling should be clear regarding choices for users.
