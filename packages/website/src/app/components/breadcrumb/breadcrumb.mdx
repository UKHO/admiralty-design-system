# Breadcrumb

Use breadcrumbs on screen sizes down to 1024 pixels wide to show the user the site architecture.

## Basic

A single Breadcrumb, to be used as part of a Breadcrumbs component.

import Basic from "@/usage/breadcrumb/basic/index.mdx";

<Basic />

## Accessibility

This component helps users have more than one way to navigate a journey which is good practice. It is built to enable easy tab and keyboard navigation. Current page in the breadcrumb is in medium weight font, for improved contrast. Ensure labelling on this component is clear.
