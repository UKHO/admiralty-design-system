# Error Summary

Use the error summary component at the top of a page to summarise any errors that a user has made. Each error message should use the same wording as the original error displayed next to the component.

Each error message should be a link that links back to the input component by using the unique `identifier` attribute of the input component.

## Contents

## Basic

This is the error summary component.

import Basic from "@/usage/error-summary/basic/index.mdx";

<Basic />

## Detailed example with links to each input

This example shows how the error message functions as a link and moves focus to the input field when clicked.

import Detailed from "@/usage/error-summary/detailed/index.mdx";

<Detailed />

## Accessibility

The error summary component is a very important way of communicating errors to a user. The error messages should be written in easy to understand and direct language.
