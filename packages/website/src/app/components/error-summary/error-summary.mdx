# Error Summary

Use the error summary component at the top of a page to summarise any errors that a user has made. [View this component on GitHub](https://github.com/UKHO/admiralty-design-system/tree/main/packages/core/src/components/error-summary)

Each error message should use the same wording as the original error message that is displayed next to the component.

For the best accessibility experience, each error message should be rendered as a link that links back to
the input component. e.g.

```html
<admiralty-link href="#name-input">Enter your name</admiralty-link>
```

which would link to the input field with the error:

```html
<admiralty-input id="name" label="What is your name?"></admiralty-input>
```

To ensure that focus is applied correctly, the internal `<input>` element of the component should be the target of the link, not the outer component wrapper. The ID of the input element is the
ID of the component suffixed with `-input`. For the example above the ID to link to is `name-input`.

When a user selects a link and fixes the error, the error message should be removed from the validation summary.

## Accessibility

The error summary component is a very important way of communicating errors to a user. The error messages should be written in easy to understand and direct language.
