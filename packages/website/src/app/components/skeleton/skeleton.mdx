# Skeleton

Skeleton loading provides a placeholder while content is loading, such as when data is being fetched from an API or the user has a slow internet connection. It helps users understand that something is happening and reduces perceived waiting time.

## Contents

## Why it’s useful

### Skeleton loading:

- Reduces perceived waiting time by showing progress visually.
- Gives users confidence that the system is working, not frozen.
- Helps maintain layout stability and prevents elements from jumping as content loads.
- Creates a more polished and consistent loading experience across products.

## When to use

### Use skeleton loading:

- When data or content needs to be loaded asynchronously (for example, from an API).
- When page or component rendering might take more than 2 – 10 seconds to load.
- When users might be on low-bandwidth connections and need reassurance that content is coming.
- For repeated patterns of content such as cards, lists, tables, or profile elements where a skeleton can visually match the final layout.

## When not to use

### Don’t use skeleton loading:

- To hide or distract from poor performance.
- If the load time exceeds 10 seconds, then it recommended that a progress bar is used as they give users a state of the system and how much longer they will need to wait.
- If the load time is less than 2 seconds skeleton loading is not necessary, as they likely wont make a difference to user experience and flashing up on the page can be annoying to users.
- If the skeleton pattern doesn’t closely resemble the eventual content structure this can cause confusion or disorientation when the content loads.

## Behaviour

- Skeletons should reflect the shape and approximate layout of the content being loaded (for example, blocks where text or images will appear).
- The transition from skeleton to real content should be smooth and instantaneous once data is ready.
- Skeletons should never remain visible for more than 10 seconds. If content still hasn’t loaded by then, display an error message or a retry option.
- The skeleton should not be interactive or selectable, it represents unavailable content.

## Accessibility

- Announce loading state: Use aria-busy="true" on containers while content is loading, and set it to false once loaded.
- Avoid motion triggers: If you use shimmer or animation effects, ensure they meet WCAG 2.3.3 (animation from interactions) and that users can disable them via prefers-reduced-motion. · Do not trap focus: Skeleton elements should not receive keyboard focus.
- Readable timing: Avoid skeleton that flash or change too quickly, as this can cause confusion for users relying on screen readers.
- Fallback content: Always provide accessible fallback text (for example, “Loading content…” for assistive technologies).

## Good practice

- Match the skeleton’s structure and proportions to the final content as closely as possible.
- Use neutral background colours that work in both light and dark modes.
- Keep animation subtle and consistent across components.
- Combine skeleton loading with lazy loading images or data only when they come into view).to improve perceived and actual performance.
- If only part of a page is loading (such as a table section or an image), apply skeletons locally rather than across the entire page.

## Content design considerations

- Be clear and honest, if content takes longer than expected, communicate it rather than leaving users waiting indefinitely.
- Use plain language for any accompanying messages (e.g. “Loading your data…” rather than “Fetching API results…”).
- Keep tone neutral and reassuring.
- Avoid filler or decorative text, skeletons should be purely visual indicators, not contain placeholder words or icons that might mislead users.
