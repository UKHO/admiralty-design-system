# Skeleton

Skeleton loading provides a placeholder while content is loading, such as when data is being fetched from an API or the user has a slow internet connection. It helps users understand that something is happening and reduces perceived waiting time.

## Contents

## Basic

import Basic from "@/usage/skeleton/basic/index.mdx"

<Basic />

## Circle Skeleton

import CircleSkeleton from "@/usage/skeleton/circle-skeleton/index.mdx"

<CircleSkeleton />

## Square Skeleton

import SquareSkeleton from "@/usage/skeleton/square-skeleton/index.mdx"

<SquareSkeleton />

## No Radius Skeleton

import NoRadiusSkeleton from "@/usage/skeleton/no-radius/index.mdx"

<NoRadiusSkeleton />

## Multi Skeleton

import MultiSkeleton from "@/usage/skeleton/multi-skeleton/index.mdx"

<MultiSkeleton />

## Accessibility

- Announce loading state: Use aria-busy="true" on containers while content is loading, and set it to false once loaded.
- Avoid motion triggers: If you use shimmer or animation effects, ensure they meet WCAG 2.3.3 (animation from interactions) and that users can disable them via prefers-reduced-motion. · Do not trap focus: Skeleton elements should not receive keyboard focus.
- Readable timing: Avoid skeleton that flash or change too quickly, as this can cause confusion for users relying on screen readers.
- Fallback content: Always provide accessible fallback text (for example, “Loading content…” for assistive technologies).
