# Card

Use cards to draw user's attention to specific content.

## With title

Use title cards to highlight content within a page, or to break certain snippets of content away from the rest of the page.

import WithTitle from "@/usage/card/with-title/index.mdx";

<WithTitle />

## Without title

Use these cards to effectively house content in a page with lots of content, for example a list of items with multiple properties.

import WithoutTitle from "@/usage/card/without-title/index.mdx";

<WithoutTitle />

## With HTML content

This card enables any content to be added to the body.

import WithHtmlContent from "@/usage/card/with-html-content/index.mdx";

<WithHtmlContent />

## Accessibility

The card titles have a strong contrast, so the card is a useful way of visibly breaking up content. Ensure labelling in the title clearly identifies the card item.
