# Select
Use to make the selection from many options easier for users.

## Basic
Use select to contain a larger number of options or when space is an issue. Options should be kept short as they may be cropped on smaller screens. Ensure the component is given a width that fits the content.

import Basic from '@/usage/select/basic/index.mdx'

<Basic/>

## Disabled
Use the disabled component when the design calls for it.

## Validation
Use validation messages to inform users that an action is required.

## Accessibility
Select is a dropdown that works with keyboard navigation and has labelling applied. Active states are increased in contrast also.
