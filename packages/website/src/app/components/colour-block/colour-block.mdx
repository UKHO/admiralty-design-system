# Colour Block

Use colour blocks to foreground links and highlighted content.

Use all the colour block examples to separate content with a clear call to action link as a way of adding colour to a page. They all support HTML content and links.

## Contents

## Admiralty Blue

import AdmiraltyBlue from "@/usage/colour-block/admiralty-blue/index.mdx";

<AdmiraltyBlue />

## Teal

import Teal from "@/usage/colour-block/teal/index.mdx";

<Teal />

## Bright Blue

import BrightBlue from "@/usage/colour-block/bright-blue/index.mdx";

<BrightBlue />

## No Redirect

When the component is being used in a framework that has its own internal navigation, it can be useful to suppress the default browser redirect for the link so that the `colourBlockLinkClicked` event can call a navigation router function. This is useful when you do not want to perform a full page reload when navigating.

import NoRedirect from "@/usage/colour-block/no-redirect/index.mdx";

<NoRedirect />

## Listener On Block

In addition to the link, the entire block can be made clickable. To ensure the component remains accessible a link should remain present.

import ListenerOnBlock from "@/usage/colour-block/listener-on-block/index.mdx";

<ListenerOnBlock />

## No Link

When no link or link text is specified the colour block will just display the header and content.

import NoLink from "@/usage/colour-block/no-link/index.mdx";

<NoLink />

## Rectangle With Longer Content

The height and width can be adjusted to suit the requirements and more complex content can be used.

import RectangleWithLongerContent from "@/usage/colour-block/rectangle-with-longer-content/index.mdx";

<RectangleWithLongerContent />

## Accessibility

Contrast levels are addressed with correct font colour for the relevant colour block. Use colour blocks over a white background. Whole block is clickable.
