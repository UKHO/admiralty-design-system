# Table
Use tables to make information easier for users to scan and compare.

## Contents

## Basic
Responsive tables will automatically adjust their column widths to fit different screen sizes.

import Basic from '@/usage/table/basic/index.mdx';

<Basic/>

## Sortable
Use a sorted table to allow users to organise the data in different orders. Use the change event to react to changes in the table sort order.

## Complex
Tables can contain and manage complex content, in this example buttons have been added.

## Accessibility
The content in a table needs to be easy to read, or have screen readers interrogate easily. The contrast of table contents is improved with background grey for intermittent rows.
