# Breadcrumbs

Use breadcrumbs on screen sizes down to 1024 pixels wide to show the user the site architecture.

## Basic

This is the basic, single breadcrumb - only use this component with more than two steps in a user journey for sensible usage.

import Basic from "@/usage/breadcrumbs/basic/index.mdx";

<Basic />

## Three crumbs

This version helps users navigate three layers into a web application, and back. Use at the top of the page, under the header and phase banner.

import ThreeCrumbs from "@/usage/breadcrumbs/three-crumbs/index.mdx";

<ThreeCrumbs />

## Accessibility

This component helps users have more than one way to navigate a journey which is good practice. It is built to enable easy tab and keyboard navigation. Current page in the breadcrumb is in medium weight font, for improved contrast. Ensure labelling on this component is clear.
