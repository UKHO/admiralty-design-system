# Expansion
Use expansion panels to contain content and save space on a page.

## Contents

## Basic
Use the expansion when you want to hide options or content.

import Basic from "@/usage/expansion/basic/index.mdx";

<Basic />

## Right aligned
Use this version if the design requires the expansion title to live alongside the clickable chevron.

import RightAligned from "@/usage/expansion/right-aligned/index.mdx";

<RightAligned />

## Expanded
Set this property when you want the expansion component to start off expanded.

import Expanded from "@/usage/expansion/expanded/index.mdx";

<Expanded />

## No border
To be used if the design requires no borders in the interface.

import NoBorder from "@/usage/expansion/no-border/index.mdx";

<NoBorder />

## Multiple
Use multiple expansion components like a list. Useful for breaking up large chunks of text into sections.

## Long
Try and keep your expansion headings short, but if this is not possible the heading will wrap onto multiple lines.

## Accessibility
Use labelling to describe the expansion heading and the content users can expect it to reveal.
