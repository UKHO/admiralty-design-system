# Modal Dialog

Use modal dialogs to show force a selection between two options.

## Contents

## Basic

This example shows a basic Modal Dialog.

import Basic from "@/usage/modal-dialog/basic/index.mdx";

<Basic />

## Accessibility

Use the label and description props to provide better accessibility for the modal dialog.

## Content Design

When using the modal dialogue, you must:
make it clear why you are displaying the modal dialogue using plain language
not assume why the modal dialogue has been triggered. For example, using language like ‘Are you sure you want to leave this page?’ when the action to exit could have been accidental
help users to understand what will happen next based on their next action.

Have clear and concise content and do not use:
jargon like 500 or bad request
‘We are experiencing technical difficulties’
red text to warn people.
