# Header

Use the header to signal to users they are in the right place. Contains primary site navigation, title and key logos.

## Contents

## Basic

The header component enables users to navigate the site and go back to home. There are a variety of versions, depending on your design.

import Basic from "@/usage/header/basic/index.mdx";

<Basic />

## Menu items

Use menu items and sub items to allow users to navigate the site. Active states let them know which page they are on.

Menu items should include a URL value for the `href` prop so that the component can render a functional link, allowing users to navigate to the specified destination when they click on the menu item. The exception is when the menu item contains sub menu items.

When a navigation router is being used, for instance in Angular or React, the default browser redirect can be suppressed. The `onMenuItemClick` event can then be used to call the framework's navigation function, which will prevent a full page reload when navigating between pages.

import MenuItem from "@/usage/header/menu-item/index.mdx";

<MenuItem />

## Signed out

Use to provide the ability for users to sign in.

import SignedOut from "@/usage/header/signed-out/index.mdx";

<SignedOut />

## Signed in

This allows users to view their profile and sign out. Use the profile button to display the user's name.

import SignedIn from "@/usage/header/signed-in/index.mdx";

<SignedIn />

## Accessibility

The header is labelled to enable ease of navigation including keyboard, tab usage.
