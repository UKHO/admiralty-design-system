# Skip Link

Some people use the tab key on their keyboard to navigate through the links and form elements on a web page.

Including the skip link component gives users the option to bypass the top-level navigation links and jump to the main content on a page.

The skip link component is visually hidden until a keyboard press activates it.

## Contents

## Basic
