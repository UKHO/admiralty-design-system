# Radio group

Use radio buttons to help users make quick decisions. A good replacement of multiple buttons. Combine multiple radio buttons together in a radio group to allow users to select at most one radio button at a time.

## Contents

## Basic

Group radio buttons together for simple questions where users can only select one option. Arrange radio options in alphabetical order by default. When there are only two options and the options are short, radio buttons can be displayed side by side.

import Basic from "@/usage/radio-group/basic/index.mdx";

<Basic />

## Labelled

Radio groups should be labelled with text that describes them. A hint can also be provided.

import Labelled from "@/usage/radio-group/labelled/index.mdx";

<Labelled />

## Disabled

Radio buttons can be disabled.

import Disabled from "@/usage/radio-group/disabled/index.mdx";

<Disabled />

## Horizontal

When there are only two options and the text is short, radio buttons can be arranged horizontally. For more than two options or when the text is longer, the radio buttons should be stacked (the default).

import Horizontal from "@/usage/radio-group/horizontal/index.mdx";

<Horizontal />

## Conditional

Related content can be revealed conditionally by passing it into a `slot` under the radio option, but only if the content be simple. Conditional content should not be added when the options are displayed horizontally.

import Conditional from "@/usage/radio-group/conditional/index.mdx";

<Conditional />

## Accessibility

Radio buttons will function with keyboard navigation. Labelling should be clear regarding choices for users. Include a descriptive label for the radio group.
