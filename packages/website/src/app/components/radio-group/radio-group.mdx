# Radio group
Use radio buttons to help users make quick decisions. A good replacement of multiple buttons. Combine multiple radio buttons together in a radio group to allow users to select at most one radio button at a time.

## Basic
Group radio buttons together for simple questions where users can only select one option. Arrange radio options in alphabetical order by default. When there are only two options and the options are short, radio buttons can be displayed side by side.

## labelled
Radio groups should be labelled with text that describes them.

## Stacked
Stack radio buttons vertically when there are more than two options.

## Accessibility
Radio buttons will function with keyboard navigation. Labelling should be clear regarding choices for users. Include a descriptive label for the radio group.
