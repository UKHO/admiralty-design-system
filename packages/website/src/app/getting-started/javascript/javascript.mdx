## Installation

If your project uses plain JavaScript (or any vanilla framework) and you are able to use a package manager (```npm``` or ```yarn```), start by installing the package so its available in your project.

### NPM

```bash
npm install @ukho/admiralty-core
```

or

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add @ukho/admiralty-core
```

## Using the components

Once you've installed the package, you can start using the components in your project.

Alternatively, if your project does not have the capability to use a package manager, you can include the package directly via the below CDN links instead.

Import the components by adding the Javascript and CSS bundles to the `index.html`. It's recommended to use [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) to access the package from a CDN. To get the latest version, add the following inside the `<head>` element.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ukho/admiralty-core/styles/admiralty.bundle.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ukho/admiralty-core/themes/default.css" />
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ukho/admiralty-core/dist/admiralty/admiralty.esm.min.js"
></script>
```

Now, you can use the components directly in your HTML files like so:

```html
<admiralty-input label="What is your name?" type="text"></admiralty-input>
```
