## Installation

For projects using Angular the first step is to install the package using a package manager so that it can be used in your project:

### NPM

```bash
npm install @ukho/admiralty-angular
```

or

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add @ukho/admiralty-angular
```

## Using the components

Once you've installed the package, you can start using the components in your project.

Import the components into your `AppModule` or specific Angular module.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/angular";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In an Angular component template, simply use the components as you would with any other HTML elements:

```html
<admiralty-input label="What is your name?" type="text"></admiralty-input>
```
