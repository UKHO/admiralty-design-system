## Overview

Components in the library can be customized by passing properties (props). These props allow you to modify the look, feel, and behavior of the component. For example a warning button:

```html
<admiralty-button variant="warning">Cancel request</admiralty-button>
```

Refer to the [component](/components) documentation for a list of available props and how they can be used.

## Styling

You can also style the components using CSS. If a component exposes custom CSS variables, you can override them in your stylesheet. For example:

```css
admiralty-button {
  --admiralty-colour-primary: #66d762;
  --admiralty-colour-primary-contrast: #f1f1f1;
}
```
