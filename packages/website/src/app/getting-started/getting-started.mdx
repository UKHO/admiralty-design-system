## Best practices

- **Lazy Loading:** In frameworks like React, make sure to use lazy loading to optimize performance.
- **Shadow DOM:** StencilJS uses the Shadow DOM to encapsulate styles and behavior. Ensure that you understand how the Shadow DOM may affect your projectâ€™s styling strategies.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that all components used follow accessibility best practices (like ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the library, here are some common solutions:

**1. Component not rendering?**

Ensure that you've imported the default styles for the components.

**2. Styles not applying?**

Check whether the component is using the Shadow DOM and if the CSS variables need to be overridden.

**3. Performance issues?**

Consider lazy loading components and using build optimizations in your framework to reduce initial load time.

## Frequently asked questions

**1. Can I use this library with Vue.js?**

At the moment, the library is optimized for JavaScript, Angular, and React. However, you can use the web components in any framework that supports custom elements, including Vue.js.

**2. How do I contribute to the library or report a bug?**

Contributions are welcome! Please refer to our [Feedback](/#feedback) section for more details.

**3. Do these components support server-side rendering (SSR)?**

StencilJS components are designed to be compatible with SSR setups like Next.js and Angular Universal. However, some configurations may be required.
