# Using the new service

This statement applies to content published on the [**designsystem.admiralty.co.uk**](https://designsystem.admiralty.co.uk/) domain. It does not apply to content on other admiralty.co.uk subdomains.

This website is run by the UK Hydrographic Office. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

-   zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
-   navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
-   navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
-   listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
-   see descriptive ALT attributes for images, which describe the image for non-visual readers
-   see title attributes for links, which describe the link in greater detail.

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

The UK Hydrographic Office is committed to making this website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

<br />

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard.

<br />

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations:

-   Some audio feedback being relayed to screen reader users does not meet the accessibility standards. For example, information was either left out, vague, or did not serve its intended purpose. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships.
-   Some of the colours and contrasts used on the website do not meet the accessibility standards. For example, low vision issues were found when attempting to understand content on the page. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast.
-   Content functionality for keyboard only users does not meet the accessibility standards. For example, issues navigating the webpage due to the missing skip link through the service. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard.

During Beta phase we will be working with our support team to update the service to solve these issues.

## How we tested this website

Accessibility Testing Approach at UKHO documents show how we plan to improve accessibility on this website and all our products and services: [**https://github.com/UKHO/docs/blob/main/quality-assurance/web-accessibility-testing.md**](https://github.com/UKHO/docs/blob/main/quality-assurance/web-accessibility-testing.md).

We use the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines V2.2 level A and level AA to test how accessible designsystem.admiralty.co.uk is.

In March 2024, the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) conducted an audit of the Design System service on designsystem.admiralty.co.uk, from which common accessibility issues across the website were identified.

<br />

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

Following the audit conducted by the DAC in March 2024, we are urgently fixing content which fails to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard.
